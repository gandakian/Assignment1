# Lesson 1 <Assignment 1>
      Mobile Computing Nov 2015
      
Today was the first day of my class at the course for Mobile Computing in Android. I got to learn a lot of things on Android Application development. From the very beginning day of the course I am loving to learn the things taught in here. I took this course so as to continue my passion in Android and I believe that this course will really help me to strengthen my knowledge.

I have always worked on Eclipse for the application development in my workpace before. And I had started learning to work on Android Studio only after I joined MUM. I had gone through the tutorials for working on with Android Studio prior to this class. Today we learnt to install, configure and run Android Studio in the class. I too followed the instructions provided. And then created a Hello World application and ran it in the tab provided to us.

Today we learnt about the Activity class and its lifecycle. We learnt what happens after every event occurs with the activity in the app. Apart from that we learnt aboout the idea of the manifest file where every activities must be declared in order to run them. Since I have always worked with xml to create layouts, and here we will be working with Java for the same purpose I am excited to learn about it. I wish to learn more and widen my knowledge in Android through this course.
